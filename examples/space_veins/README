space_Veins tutorial example.

This simulation requires veins_launchd to be started and listening for 
connections on a TCP socket, e.g. using "~/src/veins/bin/veins_launchd -vv".

The TLE data required to start the example is not shipped with space_Veins
because of unclear copyrights. However, TLE data is available in the Internet,
e.g., at <https://celestrak.com>.

To actually run the example have a look at the Makefile in the space_Veins
root directory.
